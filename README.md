Premise: Help a computer character, "Mr. Fun Guy,"  take a trip through outer space on his spaceship fueled by magic mushrooms. Click on the mushrooms to try to earn fuel points. Each round, they get more difficult to click on. When you make it through all seven rounds, you win the game and Mr. Fun Guy's spaceship takes off.

********************************************************
********************************************************

Why did I choose to make this game: I wanted to play with CSS animations and jQuery animations. I felt fairly comfortable writing JS and jQuery code but less comfortable with CSS. My original idea was to make a game in which animated objects move across the page and you have to click on them to earn points. What could be more fun to click on than mushrooms bouncing around the page?

********************************************************
********************************************************

Breakdown:

![Modal: Start Game](/screen_captures/pageload.png?raw=true)

The page loads and displays a start modal. This modal contains the directions for the game, instructing the player to click on the mushrooms that appear on screen, and a start button.

An event listener attached to the start button triggers audio.
    The first song begins playing when you click the start button. ("Cuckoo" by Tipper)
    An event listener attached to the first song starts the second song when the first song finishes playing. ("Raindrops on Roses feat. Alice D" by An-ten-nae)

Clicking on the start button also hides the start modal, and displays the game space. A timer immediately begins counting down from 30 seconds and 10*(roundNumber) mushrooms appear on screen (10 mushrooms for round 1, 20 for round 2, etc.). They have different animations for each round.

The mushrooms are randomly assigned a class of "normal", "poisonous," or "magic" using Math.random().
The mushrooms are randomly assigned a top and left margin using Math.random() - this gives the illusion that they are "scattered" across the screen randomly.

The mushrooms are given different animations for each round, using velocity.js.

An event listener is attached to each mushroom. Clicking on any mushroom will adjust the player's score.

Clicking on a magic mushroom will increase your points by 1. The magic mushroom will spin and change color, rotating through the rainbow, and then become opaque (using css animation).

Clicking on a poisonous one will decrease your points by 1. The poisonous mushroom will vibrate and become opaque (using css animation).

Clicking on a normal one will not change the score. It will remove the normal mushroom from the page.

Each mushroom can only be clicked on once. Then the event listener for that mushroom is turned off.


********************************************************
********************************************************

MOVING THROUGH EACH ROUND

At the end of each round, a modal will pop up.

![Modal: Next Round](/screen_captures/next_round_modal.png?raw=true)

If you have enough points to move on to the next round, a message will appear that will tell you you can move on, and you do so by clicking a button with an event listener attached, which triggers the next round.

The body background is reassigned for each new round to display a different gif.

![Modal: Repeat Round](/screen_captures/repeat_modal.png?raw=true)
    If you don't have enough points, the modal will prompt you to repeat the round.

Functions

********************************************************
********************************************************

EVENT HANDLERS

********************************************************
********************************************************

startGame() - attached to start button - starts audio, sets up first round with score=5 and time=30, hides modals, displays the div containing the mushrooms

clickShrooms() - attached to mushroom images - triggers different CSS animations for poisonous, magic and normal mushrooms

nextRound() - attached to next-round-button - triggers setUpRound and hides the modal that contains it

repeatRound() - attached to repeat-round-button - triggers setUpRound and hides the modal that contains it

restartGame() - attached to start button - contained in modal that pops up when you lose the game - starts game over

newGame() - attached to start button - contained in modal that pops up when you win the game - starts game over

********************************************************
********************************************************

GAME ROUND OBJECT

contains a property roundNumber that updates based on round number

clearBoard() method removes all mushrooms from their container div

generateShrooms(num) method creates num shrooms and assigns them a random class and location on the page

setTimer sets the timer to count down from 30 seconds and calls checkForWin() when time===0

roundRepeat() calls the repeat round modal

roundNext() calls the next round modal

roundAnimation(round) assigns a different animation and body background based on the round number

********************************************************
********************************************************

setUpRound(); calls the following functions:

round.clearBoard();
round.generateShrooms(round.roundNumber*10);
round.setTimer();
round.roundAnimation(round.roundNumber);
eventHandlers.clickShrooms();


checkForWin(); compares the score and the round number and determines whether the game will move on to the next round, or repeat the same round, or whether the user has won or lost the game

********************************************************
********************************************************

Approach taken:

1. Coded HTML.
2. Coded Functionality - made the game playable without any cool animation using JavaScript and jQuery. Make the modals work using CSS and event handlers.
3. Coded basic CSS. Added event listeners to mushrooms and CSS animations when you click them.
4. Updated the HTML and game premise as I went along and my idea developed.
5. Added features: Audio, velocity animations, and background gifs.

********************************************************
********************************************************

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

Could not figure out a way to make velocity fadeOut work so that the mushrooms fade out when you click on them. Instead I changed tactics and they become opaque and unclickable.

CSS: Styling the modals so that they appear centered on the page and the text stays within the div even when you resize.

********************************************************
********************************************************

ONGOING GOALS

* Media queries so you can play it on your phone
* Improve CSS
* Add audio playlist in HTML (rather than two songs using jQuery)
