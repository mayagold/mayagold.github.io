        <p id="intro-text">Mr. Fun Guy lives in a dreary, dull computer universe where everything is colored in shades of grey. On a quest to find color, he recently discovered a great secret! This universe is full of magic mushrooms. When you eat them, you develop the power to see in color. Help Mr. Fun Guy eat all the mushrooms and bring his world alive one color at a time.
          <br><br>But be careful! Some of the mushrooms out there are poisonous, and some of them don’t do anything! If you eat a poisonous mushroom, you will lose some of your power, and if you lose too much power, you won’t be able to see anything at all.
            <br><br>Are you ready to color the universe?!</p>
