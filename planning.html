Modal text:

Mr. Fun Guy lives in a dreary, dull computer universe where everything is colored in shades of grey. On a quest to find color, he recently discovered a great secret! This universe is full of magic mushrooms. When you eat them, you develop the ability to see in color. Help Mr. Fun Guy eat all the mushrooms and bring his world alive one color at a time.

But be careful! Some of the mushrooms out there are poisonous, and some of them don’t do anything! If you eat a poisonous mushroom, you will lose some of your health, and if you lose too much health, you won’t live to see the colorful universe.

Are you ready to color the universe?!

********************************************************
********************************************************

Basic format:

When the game starts, a timer immediately begins counting down from 30 seconds.
Each round of the game is generated automatically when the previous round finishes, based on current score.
Each round consists of mushrooms moving across the screen that can be clicked on.
Using math.random(), the mushrooms have all been given a class of "normal", "poisonous," or "magic."
Most of them are normal, a handful are magic and a few are poisonous.
Clicking on any mushroom will hide it so it cannot be clicked on twice.
Clicking on a magic one will increase your points by 1.
Clicking on a poisonous one will decrease your points by 1.
Clicking on a normal one will do nothing.

********************************************************

UNLOCKING COLORS

At the end of each round, if you "win" the round, a color is unlocked.

  Stretch Goals

  *reset button allows you to start over
  *Super-magic mushroom - gives you ten points and a message pops up to explain ( if math.random() > 0.95 - super rare )
  *CSS design / animations to make cool background graphics

*******************************************************
*******************************************************

Functions

... ideas, anyway ... we shall see ...


generateShrooms: creates the mushroom divs, assigns them a class poisonous/normal/magic, and appends them to the page.

setTimer: starts the timer at 30 seconds

clickShrooms: (set the mushroom image as event target) hides a mushroom when you click it and updates your score based on its class (poisonous/normal/magic)

setUpRound: called at the beginning of each new round. takes round# as input. calls generateShrooms, setTimer and clickShrooms functions to get the game in action.

checkForWin: called when time === 0. checks score and calls setUpRound for whatever round comes next

repeatRound: message to player that they can't move on yet and they need to repeat the round. called between rounds based on score at end of previous round

nextRound: message to player that they can move on to the next round of the game.

unlockColor: shows a hidden background div

*******************************************************
*******************************************************

Workflow plan

1. Code HTML.
2. Code Functionality - make the game work without any cool animation (just make the mushrooms clickable, they don't have to move). Make the modals work and the rounds flow like they're supposed to.
3. Code basic CSS - make the mushrooms move in a basic way
4. Mushroom animations
5. Background color divs - design
